# CoreWorker
Advanced process management with more control, but less code.

# Motivation
Because we believe working with processes in node.js needs too much boilerplate code for most use cases, we reevaluated the current process API and finally build CoreWorker.

CoreWorker aims at simplifying process management by making the most prominent lifefcycle events/states explicit so that they can be awaited. This is done by wrapping some events and hooks (to determine when the events are fired) around node's internal process module.

# Installation

You may install CoreWorker with npm 
```js
npm install core-worker
``` 

# API
By default you can import CoreWorker by ```import { process } from "core-worker";```. Just call process with a ```command``` and an optional ```condition```, which is used to determine the moment when the proccess is ready, to receive an instance. A command has to use absolute paths and should be the same as on your os specific command line interface.
```
typedef process:    Command -> Condition? -> Process
typedef Condition:  Nil | String | String -> Boolean | RegExp
typdef Command:     String
```
Now you are able to interact with the returned instance in multiple ways: You can wait until the process is ready or dead or use it for example as a stream.  Additionally it is always possible to kill your instance with ```instance.kill()```.
```
typedef Process: {
    ready:  Timeout  -> Result
    death:  Timeout? -> Result
    stream: Nil      -> Stream
    kill:   Nil      -> Nil
}
typedef Timeout: Index
```
```instance.ready``` or ```instance.death``` will return a Promise object, that either gets fullfilled with a ```Result``` or rejected with an ```Error```. If you set a RegExp as the condition, ```Result``` will contain the matched string - otherwise it contains ```Nil```.
```
typedef Result:  {
    data: String | Nil
}
```
```Ã¬nstance.stream``` exposes the instance's stdin and stdout/stderr as a duplexstream. As result you can prepend a readstream and append a writestream to your duplexstream.
```
typedef Stream: {
    write: String | Buffer -> Nil
    pipe:  Stream          -> Nil
}
```

# Usage
If you just want to wait until your process is ready, create a process with your desired command and condition. The condition is used to filter incoming data from stdout/stderr until it is triggered. In this case the process has reached its ready state.
This can happen in three different ways: 
  1. The ```condition``` is a string and the output contains this string
  2. The ```condition``` is a regular expression and the output is a match
  3. The ```condition``` is a function, takes the output and returns ```true```

Afterwards you can await the ready-state with a specified timeout.
```js
import { process } from "core-worker";

const result = await process("your command", "condition").ready(1000);
```
Besides you can wait until your process is finished, shown in the example below. This time a condition does not need to be set, unless you want to wait until the process is ready, too. Afterwards the finished state is awaitable with or without a specified timeout.
```js
import { process } from "core-worker";

const result = await process("your command").death();
```
If you want to compose a chain of streams containing your process, you can use ```instance.stream``` to write data into ```instance.stdin``` and read data out of ```instance.stdout/instance.stderr```.
```js
import { process } from "core-worker";

readstream.pipe(process("your command").stream()).pipe(writestream);
```
# Examples
The following examples show how some common use cases are solved using CoreWorker:

## Wait until process is ready
Let's suppose we want to wait until our http-server is ready - but no longer than 1000 milliseconds
So first we write a simple server script ...
```js
//Server.js
const server = http.createServer(...);

server.listen(1337, "127.0.0.1", function() {
    // This log will notify our main process when the server is ready to use
    console.log("Server is ready.");
});
```
... and finally execute it with CoreWorker:
```js
//startServer.js
import { process } from "core-worker";

try {
    /*
     * Here we define "Server is ready" as our condiition and use a timeout of 1000ms.
     * Accordingly, the process gets ready when a log contains this string within the given timeout.
     */
    const result = await process("node Server.js", "Server is ready.").ready(1000);
    
    console.log(result);
} catch(err) {
    // handle err
}
```
The example will start the HTTP-Server and returns a ```Promise```, that either gets resolved with a ```Result``` or rejected with an ```error```. CoreWorker now evaluates any output with the condition "Server is ready.". If it succesfully validates within 1000 milliseconds, the promise gets resolved with an empty result - otherwise it gets rejected.
Keep in mind, that ```Result``` can also return the matched string, if your condition is a regular expression.

## Wait until process has finished
This example shows how to wait for a process to be successfully executed and closed.
This time we want to copy a given file, named "/path/to/file" with the "cp"-command into a new location "/newLocation/copiedFile" and wait until this operation has successfully finished:

```js
import { process } from "core-worker";

try {
    const result = await process("cp path/to/file /newLocation/newFile").death();
    
    // work with result
} catch(err) {
    // handle err
}
```
The example ignores the timeout, since we promise that only this time it's really acceptable to wait until the end of days for our copy operation to finish :astonished:. So Process.death allows you to omit this parameter, even though this isn't recommmended and even forbidden when awaiting the ready state of a process.

## Use process as stream
This examples shows how to compose single processes unix-style. But instead of using the pipe operator "|" (e.g. cat file.txt | grep something), we can combine them with the canonical "pipe" method exposed by every node.js stream:

So let's assume that we want to read a file "/private/movie/project", ...
```
It is a period of civil war. Rebel spaceships, striking from a hidden base,
have won their first victory against the evil Galactic Empire.
During the battle, Rebel spies managed to steal secret plans to the Empire's ultimate weapon,
the DEATH STAR, an armored space station with enough power to destroy an entire planet.
Pursued by the Empire's sinister agents, Princess Leia races home aboard her starship, 
custodian of the stolen plans that can save her people and restore freedom to the galaxy . . .
```
... grep for "galaxy" and write the results to "/ocurrences"
```js
import { process } from "CoreWorker";
import fs from "fs";

fs.createReadStream(file)
    .pipe(process("grep galaxy").stream())
    .pipe(fs.createWriteStream("/ocurrences"));
```
By using processes as streams you are generally able to create language agnostic and easily manageable data transform pipelines out of single processes via node.js.

## Use all process functions at once
Sometimes it is necessary to get notified about multiple state changes of a single instance of a specific process and at the same time interact with it. Accordingly the next example shows you how to work with multiple instance states at once. 
As an example we use a simple chat application, that logs "Chat ready", when it is able to accept messages.
```js
import { process } from "core-worker";

const simpleChat = process("node chat.js", "Chat ready");
const chatInput  = process.stream();

process.stdin.pipe(chatInput).pipe(process.stdout);
setTimeout(() => simpleChat.kill(), 360000); // wait an hour and close the chat

try {
      await simpleChat.ready(500);
      console.log("You are now able to send messages.");

      await simpleChat.death();
      console.log("Chat closed");
} catch(err) {
    // handle err
}
```
Please note that ```instance.stream``` throws an error, if you execute ```instance.ready/instance.death``` before.

# Testing

You can test CoreWorker with mocha by executing ```make test``` in the root directory of the project.
